## About me
**Communication**

Since I have been a judge for a tabletop game, I have many experiences to communicate with others.<br>
 One of the most important works for judge is explained the complex situation to both of the players and persuade them with the reasonable resolves. It required judges be familiar with the rule wording, and express them in a way that all the players can accept. In past four years, I handled over 400 ruling problem and achieved the consensus with different players.

**Leadership**<br>

I’m also good at presentation and group work management. One of my abilities is interact with group members and push the work forward.
