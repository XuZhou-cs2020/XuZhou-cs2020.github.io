           As one of the most famous tabletop game, Yugioh's tournament need judges to keep the order, answer the different questions about the game wording and negotiate between players. I passed my tier 1 judge test in 2019 and have been an active judge. Focusing on answer different ruling question with complex wording and helping manage small tournaments.

     **Skills & Abilities**\
     Usage of variant databases\
     Programming about the algorithm related to AI\
     Interface design for application

     **Some skills out of CSâ€¦**\
     Face to face negotiation\
     Translation between Japanese, English and Chinese\
     Photoshop and power point design\
     Presentation

     **Communication**\
     Since I have been a judge for a tabletop game, I have many experiences to communicate with others.
     One of the most important works for judge is explained the complex situation to both of the players and persuade them with the reasonable resolves. It required judges be familiar with the rule wording, and express them in a way that all the players can accept. In past four years, I handled over 400 ruling problem and achieved the consensus with different players.

     **Leadership**\
     I'm also good at presentation and group work management. One of my abilities is interact with group members and push the work forward.
